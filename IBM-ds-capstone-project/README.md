# IBM Data Science Capstone Project
This project is the final project of the 10-course [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)
## Winning Space Race with Data Science
### Description
_In this course you will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders._
_You will be tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch._
